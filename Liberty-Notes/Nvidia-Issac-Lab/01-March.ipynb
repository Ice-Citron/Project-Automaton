    "1. THE NEW DEPENDENCIES: WHY DO WE NEED THEM?\n",
    "    To handle physics, we introduce four new imports:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - `torch`: Used for high-performance tensor computations. Instead of \n",
    "      iterating through objects one by one in Python (which is very slow), Isaac\n",
    "      Sim uses PyTorch to calculate the positions, velocities, and states of\n",
    "      thousands of objects simultaneously on the GPU.\n",
    "    - `math_utils`: Provides mathematical utilities specifically for simulation,\n",
    "      like randomising the spawn positions of objects.\n",
    "    - `RigidObjectCfg`: The configuration class. This is where you define the\n",
    "      \"blueprint\" of the object (its mass, its 3D mesh, its initial spawn state)\n",
    "    - `RigidObject`: The actual active class that represents the spawned object\n",
    "      in the simulation, managing its physical properties and state.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `design_scene()`: THE NEW WAY TO SPAWN OBJECTS\n",
    "    In previous tutorials, you used basic `func` methods to spawn the ground \n",
    "    plane and lights. While great for simple scenes, it is terrible for complex\n",
    "    setups (like a bin full of 500 lego bricks) because it is repetitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "THE NEW APPROACH\n",
    "    Instead of spawning objects manually, we wrap the spawn configuration inside\n",
    "    `RigidObjectCfg`\n",
    "\n",
    "    - HOW IT WORKS BY EXAMPLE: First, the code creates multiple `XForm` prims\n",
    "      (empty anchor points in 3D space) named `world/origin_0`, `world/origin1`,\n",
    "      etc.\n",
    "    - THE REGEX MAGIC: When you pass the configuration to the `RigidObject` \n",
    "      class, you give it a regular expression  path (like `world/origin.*`). The\n",
    "      engine automatically finds every matching anchor point and spawns a child\n",
    "      object (a Cone in this video) under it automatically.\n",
    "    - THE RESULT: You instantly get `world/origin_0/cone`, `world/origin_1/cone`\n",
    "      , etc., all with their physics handles already initialised. The initial\n",
    "      state defaults to the \"identity pose\" (Position 0, Rotation 0, Velocity 0)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `run_simulation()`: THE PHYSICS LOOP\n",
    "    This function is the heartbeat of your simulation. it runs at a time step of\n",
    "    0.017 seconds (roughly 60 Hz).\n",
    "\n",
    "    Inside this loop, the video introduces a mechanism to reset the cones every\n",
    "    250 steps so they drop again. To do this correctly, you must understand a \n",
    "    critical concept: THE WORLD FRAME. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "THE \"WORLD FRAME\" TRAP:\n",
    "    When you want to teleport an object (like resetting a Lego piece to the top\n",
    "    of the workspace), you cannot just give it a relative local positon based on\n",
    "    its parent anchor. The physics engine operates strictly in the GLOBAL \n",
    "    COORDINATE SYSTEM (WORLD FRAME).\n",
    "\n",
    "    - THE FIX: You must calculate the object's exact global position and \n",
    "      movement, then apply a random offset (using `sample_cylinder`) so the \n",
    "      cones don't drop in the exact same spot every time. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. THE 5-STEP UPDATE CYCLE\n",
    "    To actually apply these resets and make the simulation run, you must follow\n",
    "    a very specific order of operations inside the loop. If you mess this order\n",
    "    up when training your RL agent later, your simulation will break or return\n",
    "    garbage data:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. `write_root_state_to_sim()`: You take the new, randomised global \n",
    "       positions of the cones and push them directly into the physics engine.\n",
    "    2. `reset()`: You clear out any old, internal physics data (like residual\n",
    "       momentum from the previous drop) so the object starts fresh.\n",
    "    3. `write_data_to_sim()`: If you were applying external forces (like a robot\n",
    "       arm pushing the cone), you write that data to the simulation buffer here.\n",
    "       (It is unused in this specific tutorial, but included as standard \n",
    "       practice).\n",
    "    4. `sim.step()`: You tell the physics engine to calculate the next frame of\n",
    "       reality (gravity pulls the cone down, collisions are calculated).\n",
    "    5. `rigid_object.update()`: You pull the newly calculated physics data back\n",
    "       out of the simulation and update the internal PyTorch buffers. The new\n",
    "       data is now stored in the `rigid_object.data` attribute, ready for the \n",
    "       next loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "    When you transition to Phase 3 of your roadmap (The Capstone), your RL agent\n",
    "    will live entirely inside this cycle. It will observe `rigid_object.data` to\n",
    "    see where the Lego piece is, calcualte an action for the SO-100 arm, write\n",
    "    those forces to the sim, step the simulation, and repeat. "
