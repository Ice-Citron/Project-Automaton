    "2. THE FACTORY METHOD (`.func`)\n",
    "    In Isaac Lab, every configuration object has a property called `func`. This\n",
    "    property is literally a pointer to the specific Python function (the factory\n",

    "    To handle physics, we introduce four new imports:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - `torch`: Used for high-performance tensor computations. Instead of \n",
    "      iterating through objects one by one in Python (which is very slow), Isaac\n",
    "      Sim uses PyTorch to calculate the positions, velocities, and states of\n",
    "      thousands of objects simultaneously on the GPU.\n",
    "    - `math_utils`: Provides mathematical utilities specifically for simulation,\n",
    "      like randomising the spawn positions of objects.\n",
    "    - `RigidObjectCfg`: The configuration class. This is where you define the\n",
    "      \"blueprint\" of the object (its mass, its 3D mesh, its initial spawn state)\n",
    "    - `RigidObject`: The actual active class that represents the spawned object\n",
    "      in the simulation, managing its physical properties and state.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `design_scene()`: THE NEW WAY TO SPAWN OBJECTS\n",
    "    In previous tutorials, you used basic `func` methods to spawn the ground \n",
    "    plane and lights. While great for simple scenes, it is terrible for complex\n",
    "    setups (like a bin full of 500 lego bricks) because it is repetitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "THE NEW APPROACH\n",
    "    Instead of spawning objects manually, we wrap the spawn configuration inside\n",
    "    `RigidObjectCfg`\n",
    "\n",
    "    - HOW IT WORKS BY EXAMPLE: First, the code creates multiple `XForm` prims\n",
    "      (empty anchor points in 3D space) named `world/origin_0`, `world/origin1`,\n",
    "      etc.\n",
    "    - THE REGEX MAGIC: When you pass the configuration to the `RigidObject` \n",
    "      class, you give it a regular expression  path (like `world/origin.*`). The\n",
    "      engine automatically finds every matching anchor point and spawns a child\n",
    "      object (a Cone in this video) under it automatically.\n",
    "    - THE RESULT: You instantly get `world/origin_0/cone`, `world/origin_1/cone`\n",
    "      , etc., all with their physics handles already initialised. The initial\n",
    "      state defaults to the \"identity pose\" (Position 0, Rotation 0, Velocity 0)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `run_simulation()`: THE PHYSICS LOOP\n",
    "    This function is the heartbeat of your simulation. it runs at a time step of\n",
    "    0.017 seconds (roughly 60 Hz).\n",
    "\n",
    "    Inside this loop, the video introduces a mechanism to reset the cones every\n",
    "    250 steps so they drop again. To do this correctly, you must understand a \n",
    "    critical concept: THE WORLD FRAME. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "THE \"WORLD FRAME\" TRAP:\n",
    "    When you want to teleport an object (like resetting a Lego piece to the top\n",
    "    of the workspace), you cannot just give it a relative local positon based on\n",
    "    its parent anchor. The physics engine operates strictly in the GLOBAL \n",
    "    COORDINATE SYSTEM (WORLD FRAME).\n",
    "\n",
    "    - THE FIX: You must calculate the object's exact global position and \n",
    "      movement, then apply a random offset (using `sample_cylinder`) so the \n",
    "      cones don't drop in the exact same spot every time. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. THE 5-STEP UPDATE CYCLE\n",
    "    To actually apply these resets and make the simulation run, you must follow\n",
    "    a very specific order of operations inside the loop. If you mess this order\n",
    "    up when training your RL agent later, your simulation will break or return\n",
    "    garbage data:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. `write_root_state_to_sim()`: You take the new, randomised global \n",
    "       positions\n",
