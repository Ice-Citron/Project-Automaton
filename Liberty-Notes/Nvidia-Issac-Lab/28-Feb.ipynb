    "highlighted here is that the simulation app must be launched before importing \n",
    "the core Isaac Lab physics and context modules to avoid crashes. From there, the\n",

    "Finally, the video covers the mechanics of actually running the simulation over\n",
    "time. It makes an important distinction between the `reset()` method--which is\n",

    "The second tutorial focuses on populating the empty stage you created in the\n",
